## Objective

world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:

- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
